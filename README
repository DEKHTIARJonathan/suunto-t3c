Trying to reverse engineer Suunto's sync protocol to enable reading data
from the watch on Linux.

Current progress:
Installed Moveslink on Windows virtual machine running on VirtualBox.
USB PC Pod connected to VM. Wireshark running on Linux host PC.

Successfully captured USB data of sync between Suunto Moveslink software
and t3c watch. (see suunto-sync-usb.pcap)

Now writing Python/libpcap script to parse captured USB data, so I can
extract the Suunto comms.
